Learn vocabulary App
====================

[![Tests status](https://travis-ci.com/Ovski4/learn-vocabulary-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Ovski4/learn-vocabulary-app)

An android application that will help you learn vocabulary in any language. Created with react native.

This app is not available on the play store anymore due to limitations with the expo framework (See this issue https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/2217#issuecomment-422497781) which contains code triggering a Violation of Usage. As this application do not and will not send data to any third party system, I prefer to wait for the issue to be solved properly before resubmitting it on the play store.
